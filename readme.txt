# My-shopping-list

In this simple challenge I want to make a simple shopping list example that allows dynamicaly add items via input and button. 
When you add an item to the input and press the button:
 - The item will appear in the list
 - Each item will have a button that can be pressed to delete the item off the list
 - The input will get empty and ready to enter another item
